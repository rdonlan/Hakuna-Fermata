# Hakuna-Fermata

Brainstorming Ideas:

1.	Out of My League – Fitz and the Tantrums
a.	  I enjoy that it has slow parts but also speeds up
b.	  It reminds me of studying because I used it as background noise to study so much
c.	  I feel like it just fades into the background so nicely
2.	Another Day in Paradise – Quinn XCII
a.	  I feel like the song takes me on a journey
b.	  Makes me feel happy
c.	  It brings me to a good state of mind
3.	Dissolve – Absofacto
a.	  It has a good mix of slow relaxing and a little more upbeat sound
b.	  It reminds me a lot of hanging in my room during quarantine circa April 2020
c.	  It is calming but also has some parts that move faster and I think subconsciously it makes me move a little faster so I get some good studying in
